About a week ago I stumbled upon this massive belief, in fact is was so big I had previously mistaken it to be 'the way things are' and didn't think of it as something that prevented me from enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive. The belief was that I could not achieve an actual freedom in this lifetime: I mean, sure, maybe some people down in Australia can do it, or some random strangers on the interwebs. But me? It was certainly something not fully considered before; the fact that it could be done. On a day just like this I will be no more?

Now I see this impossibility was yet another belief, a belief that I could not do it, going all the way in this lifetime: I would have to settle for 'making the best of it'. If this was just a belief it entails an actual freedom could actually happen at some point! Reversed, there's no need for me to believe I can do it, because it's simply a matter of enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive, either I am or I am not.

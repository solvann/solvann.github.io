About a week ago I stumbled upon a very big belief, in fact is was so big I had previously mistaken it for 'the way things are'. The belief was that I could not achieve an actual freedom in this lifetime. I mean, maybe some people down in Australia can do it, or some random folks on the internet, but me? It was something I haven't thought about before, I figured I would do my best and see what happens. Now I see this was all another belief, the belief that I could not do it, at least not in this lifetime, meaning it will actually happen at some point. There's also no need for me to believe I can do it, because it's a matter of fact, like building a house; if I put up four walls and a roof then a house is built. Nothing to it but to do it, which means it can be actually be done.

title: Breaking beliefs

How wonderful it is to break a new belief, when it evaporates and leave only freedom. That sense of freedom must be one of the sweetest thing a human being can experience. It needs to be an absolute sincere, genuine and honest investigation of the belief. When I recognize a belief that's standing in the way of my happiness it can be tempting to simply think "it would be nice to get rid of this", but that doesn't do it. Wanting, wishing, hoping and dreaming have little to no effect. I need to look at the underlying cause of it -- why does it even exist in the first place? How did it come to be? Often the fear of actually changing my self, who I feel I am, will block me from looking directly into the cause. After all I'm trading in a piece of 'me' for a piece of freedom.

Yesterday I realized that being sad is not worth it's effect: not enjoying being alive. It's less important to be sad then to enjoy being alive. Sure, I will still become sad again because I still feel there are plenty of things that are worth being sad about, but now there are one less sadness inducing belief and the more beliefs that keeps breaking the less integrity the remaining beliefs will have.

Of course I thought about this many times before but yesterday it 'clicked', and it's that 'click' -- when the belief actually breaks -- that's my cue to trace back and look at why it 'clicked' just this time. That's another upside, in addition to increased freedom, if I break a belief then the same mechanism applies to all belief, hence it's important to take a mental note on what actually worked so I can use that knowledge and be pragmatic about it the next time around.
